Repository used to store files related to learning Node.js

The reference file is where most of the good stuff is. Look in there and you'll find key functions for common Node.js modules along with explainations for each.

The index.js file also details how to set up a very simple server as well as how to respond with files and add the correct meta data to your response type.
